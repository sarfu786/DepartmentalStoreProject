# DepartmentalStoreProject
The DepartmentalStore Java project uses collections like Set and HashMap to implement methods for adding, displaying, and buying products, as well as a checkout feature. If a wrong input is entered, a runtime exception is thrown. This project demonstrates the use of collections and exception handling in a retail store context.

The DepartmentalStore project is a Java application that allows users to add, display, and buy products from a departmental store. The project utilizes collections such as Set and HashMap to store and manage products in the store.

The add product operation allows the user to add a new product to the store with details such as name, price, quantity, and type. The display operation displays all the products in the store with their details.

The buy product operation allows the user to buy a product from the store by specifying the product name and quantity. If the specified quantity is greater than the available quantity, a runtime exception is thrown indicating that the product is out of stock.

The checkout method is used to calculate the total cost of the products bought by the user and generates a bill with the product details and the total cost.

Overall, the project provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for managing products in a departmental store.
